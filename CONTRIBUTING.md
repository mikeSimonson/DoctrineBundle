 ## Reporting issues

 If your issue is related to sql, note that the DoctrineBundle doesn't generate any sql.
 Your issue is most likely a [doctrine dbal](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DBAL/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:issues-panel) or [doctrine orm issue](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:issues-panel) depending on what you used.
 Please report your issue in their bugtracker.
